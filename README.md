# GeneticAlgorithm
A simple genetic algorithm utilizing a black box function written 100% in java.  
The blackbox function was decompiled from a .class file so the source is not very readabl, but I will elarn what it does and update it.  
The data set is from a random generator.

## How To Use
Compile the code into .class files and run "java GA" in terminal.
